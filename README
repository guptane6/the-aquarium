This project was developed to simulate a virtual aquarium, complete with swimming fish and other items. It was made on a linux machine using NetBeans' project options, so the makefile is the default makefile used by NetBeans.

Therefore, to run this, the files must be unzipped and opened in NetBeans and then run.  For any further information, please contact me at neharg07@gmail.com or 9894921054
