This project was developed to simulate a virtual aquarium, complete with swimming fish and other items.

To run it, type: 
'make -f Makefile.mak'
./Aquarium


The save and load options allow a user of the program to open and save a .aqua file which will store the items
on the screen and their current locations. The "trash can" option will toggle a trash can, allowing users to
delete the items or fish on the screen.


For any further information, please contact me.
It is highly possible that this code will not download correctly from Github due to size constraints from github's recommended maximum size per file. The wxwidgets library, used in this, exceeds that maximum size.
