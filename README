This project was developed to simulate a virtual aquarium, complete with swimming fish and other items.

To run it, type: 
'make -f Makefile.mak'
./Aquarium


The save and load options allow a user of the program to open and save a .aqua file which will store the items
on the screen and their current locations. The "trash can" option will toggle a trash can, allowing users to
delete the items or fish on the screen.
